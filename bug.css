The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code intends to make two divs occupy half the width of their container each. However, if the parent container's width is not specified and it is not a block level element, some browsers might not render them correctly because of the `float:left` property which removes the element from the document flow.
